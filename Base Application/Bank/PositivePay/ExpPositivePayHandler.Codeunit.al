/// The Export Positive Pay Handler codeunit manages the flow of filter information during positive pay exports.
/// It stores user-defined check ledger entry filters and provides them to the export pre-mapping processes.
/// This ensures that only the checks meeting the specified criteria are included in the positive pay export file.
/// The codeunit uses event subscription to integrate with the export framework without tight coupling.
