/// collection orchestration for grouping and processing payments, SEPA-compliant XML generation

/// and automated status tracking throughout the process lifecycle.
/// 
/// The namespace integrates with core banking functionality through bank account management,
/// customer data for mandate validation, and general journal processing for posting.
/// Extension points include custom validation rules, specialized export formats,
/// and integration event handling for third-party payment processors.
/// 
/// Dependencies include Microsoft.Bank.BankAccount for account management,
/// Microsoft.Sales.Customer for mandate relationships, Microsoft.Finance.GeneralLedger.Journal
